# Multi-Omics-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to develop an accurate predictive model for disease detection using multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.). By integrating heterogeneous omics data and identifying biomarkers, deep learning techniques will be applied to predict disease likelihood.
